# OBMetaProducerBukkit

Minecraft bukkit/spigot plugin to gather meta data for use by external tools, utilities and monitoring.
For now this only outputs player position data every 5 seconds for use with player markers on our Overviewer maps.

This is very specific to our needs and setup so of not much value to anyone out there I would think.

Compiled for Bukkit/Spigot/Minecraft 1.21 and compiled with Java 21.
